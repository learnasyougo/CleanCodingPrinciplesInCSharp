# About
Clean code is the art of writing code that humans can understand. Learn how to write C# in a style that's easy to write, read, and maintain. This course is filled with clear comparisons between "dirty" C# code to avoid, and the "clean" C# equivalent.

## <a name="codeiscommunication"></a>Code is Communication
> Code is like humor, if you have to explain it, it's bad.
> ~ [Cory House](https://twitter.com/housecor)

> Programming is the art of telling _another human_ what one wants the computer to do.
> ~ [Donald Knuth]()

> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that _humans_ can understand.
> ~ [Martin Fowler](https://twitter.com/martinfowler)

## <a name="reasonstocare"></a>Reasons to Care
1. Reading is harder than writing
1. Technical debt is despressing
1. Laziness (extra care in code up front, so it's easier to adapt/read)
1. Sloppiness equals slowing us down
1. Don't be a verb (aka _this code has been Jimmified_)...

## <a name="weareauthors"></a>We are authors
Each line of code is likely to be read 10 times by another human, so we have to strive to be proper authors, as in fact we are.
Authors are writers of a book, article or text and:
- one who practices writing as a profession (_writing code_)
- one who writes or constructs an electronic document or system (_yes, we make systems)
- an originator or creator of a theory or plan (_we do fall under this category as well_)

An author strive to tell a compelling, clear, story. We have to take this in mind when doing so. The tools and conventions of _clean code principles_ help us to achieve this.
